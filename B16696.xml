            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>☞ <hi>Note,</hi> That all the Benefited Tickets are orderly numbred, beginning with 1, and ending at 201 inclusive, thus: The two first being single Lots, are numbred 1, 2; the next being two Lots, are numbred 3, 4; and so the next being four, are numbred 5, 6, 7, 8; and the next being eight, are numbred 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16; and so on successively, still continuing the number of Lots where the other ends, to 201 inclusive, as before; beside the first drawn Ticket, its Lot N. A, and last drawn Ticket, its Lot N. B; that every one may know their own particular Lot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Observe,</hi> For the incouragement of Adventurers, that all these Fine Laces and Flat Points before-mentioned, shall be put up in such Lots or Parcels, as shall be fit for any Shopkeeper to Retail them, or for any other Person to make up as they shall think fit; and they shall be put up at the first cost they were lately bought for by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased, Mr. <hi>Jonathan Fawconer,</hi> the necessary Charges in the disposal of them (as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways usual in such Cases) only excepted; there being no other end or design in their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking (which shall be but once) but the quick disposal of the said Goods.</p>
            <p>And for the greater satisfaction of all that the Goods are so put up at the prime cost, there has been an Account taken of them (in the presence of Mr. <hi>Benjamin Hill,</hi> at the <hi>Angel</hi> in the <hi>Poultrey)</hi> by Mr. <hi>David Abbot,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Richard Lucas</hi> Lacemen, at the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razens-Head</hi> in <hi>Friday-Street;</hi> which two latter very well knew the Deceased, Mr. <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than Fawconer</hi>'s Mark, insomuch as here can't be any fraudulent dealing, but you will have every thing at the first hand: And the aforesaid Lacemen will be careful to see the same Goods put up in Lots or Parcels Proportionable to each respective Ticket.</p>
            <p>These Persons following (not interested in this matter) do offer to be security for the Just and Regular performance of these Proposals; and do likewise promise, that Three or more of them will be present, to see the same rightly managed, <hi>(Viz.)</hi> Mr. <hi>Hill,</hi> Mr. <hi>Abbot,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ashfield,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rose,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ambrous</hi> and Mr. <hi>Burford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is hoped that the whole Number of Tickets may be compleated by the Twentyeth of <hi>March</hi> next; but if sooner, publick Notice shall be given in the <hi>Gazzette,</hi> the time when, and place where the Tickets shall be drawn.</p>
            <p>At the Late Mr. <hi>Jonathan Fawconer</hi>'s House in <hi>Aldermanbury,</hi> over against the <hi>Conduit,</hi> the Goods may be seen by any Person till the time of their disposal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>☞ <hi>Note,</hi> That all Persons that are the Buyers of the aforesaid Goods, are desired to send for them away in six days after the Drawing of the Lots, and to bring or send their Tickets signed by either of the Persons following; which will warrant the Delivery of them.</hi>
